# 🔧 **Bill Context Fix - AI Now Uses Specific Bill Details**

## ❌ **Problem Identified:**

### **AI Responses Lacked Bill Details**
- AI responses were generic: "I'm calling about a billing issue"
- No specific customer names, account numbers, dates, or amounts mentioned
- Context was set once but not refreshed during conversation
- Example bill lacked properly formatted customer name

## ✅ **Root Causes Fixed:**

### **1. Missing Context Refresh in Speech Processing**
- **❌ Problem**: Context only set in initial dispute-call route
- **✅ Solution**: Added context refresh in process-speech route for every AI response

### **2. Enhanced Example Bill Data**
- **❌ Problem**: Example bill missing customer name in detectable format
- **✅ Solution**: Added "CUSTOMER NAME: John Smith" to example bill

### **3. Improved AI Instructions**
- **❌ Problem**: AI not explicitly told to use specific bill details
- **✅ Solution**: Enhanced instructions to ALWAYS use specific details

### **4. Added Comprehensive Logging**
- **✅ Added**: Debug logging to track context availability and usage

## 🔧 **Technical Fixes Implemented:**

### **1. Context Refresh in Speech Processing** (`process-speech/route.ts`)
```javascript
// Ensure dispute context is set for AI response generation
const disputeData = getDisputeData(disputeId);
if (disputeData) {
  setDisputeContext(disputeId, {
    disputeId,
    company: disputeData.company,
    amount: disputeData.amount,
    description: disputeData.description,
    accountNumber: disputeData.accountNumber,
    customerName: disputeData.customerName,
    billType: disputeData.billType,
    transactionId: disputeData.transactionId,
    chargeDate: disputeData.chargeDate,
    dueDate: disputeData.dueDate,
    billingPeriod: disputeData.billingPeriod,
    previousBalance: disputeData.previousBalance,
    currentCharges: disputeData.currentCharges,
    totalAmount: disputeData.totalAmount,
    phoneNumber: disputeData.phoneNumber,
  });
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Example Bill** (`documentProcessor.ts`)
```
ELECTRIC COMPANY                    ELECTRIC BILL
(407) 404-4156

CUSTOMER NAME                       AMOUNT DUE
John Smith                          $512.46

SERVICE ADDRESS                     
1234 MAIN STREET                    

BILLING DATE                        DATE DUE
April 6, 2024                       April 22, 2024

SUMMARY OF CHARGES                  ACCOUNT NUMBER
PREVIOUS BALANCE                    5678 9101
CURRENT CHARGES                     $512.46
```

### **3. Enhanced AI Instructions** (`aiService.ts`)
```
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be polite, professional, and persistent
2. ALWAYS use specific bill details (customer name, account number, dates, amounts) in your responses
3. Reference the exact charge date, amount, and account information when relevant
4. Keep responses concise (under 50 words) but include key details
5. Don't mention you are an AI - speak as the customer
6. Be direct and focused on getting the charge resolved
```

### **4. Enhanced Initial Greeting Instructions**
```
Generate a natural opening statement (under 50 words) that:
1. Greets the representative politely and introduces yourself by name if available
2. States you're calling about a billing issue with specific account details
3. Mentions the specific charge amount and date if available
4. Briefly describes the nature of the dispute

ALWAYS include specific details like customer name, account number, charge date, and amount when available.
```

### **5. Comprehensive Debug Logging**
```javascript
console.log('AI Response Generation - Dispute Context:', {
  disputeId,
  hasContext: !!context,
  company: context?.company,
  customerName: context?.customerName,
  amount: context?.amount,
  chargeDate: context?.chargeDate,
  accountNumber: context?.accountNumber
});
```

## 🗣️ **Expected AI Responses Now:**

### **Before (Generic):**
```
"Hi, I'm calling about a billing issue. There seems to be a charge I'd like to dispute."
```

### **After (Specific Details):**
```
"Hi, this is John Smith calling about my Electric Company bill. I have account number 5678 9101 and I'm disputing a charge of $512.46 from April 6, 2024."
```

### **Follow-up Responses:**
```
Rep: "What's the issue with the charge?"
AI: "My previous balance was $489.37, but the current charges show $512.46. I believe there's an unauthorized charge that I never agreed to."

Rep: "Can you confirm your account details?"
AI: "Yes, my account number is 5678 9101, and the charge date was April 6, 2024. The total amount due is $512.46."
```
